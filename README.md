# *** NOTE: this is NOT my final version of the project!

Although the application works fine, its NOT my final version of the Chess game. i mistakenly deleted the last updated version of the game, when i was deleting old code files and directories :(
This version was made couple of days before the finished version. it lacks some features like sounds, additional graphics, code, optimization... 
but still got the main important functions and features to run the application.

Features:
  1. Play vs AI: 3 levels, the hardest level is depth of 3 (depth tree for minimax search). the AI based on Minimax Search with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
  2. Play vs human on the same computer or via LAN.
  3. Undo moves – option to reverse the game at any time 1 move back, by pressing ‘p’.
  4. Restart game by pressing 'r'.
  5. Timer (not in this version).
  6. Choose color board.
  7. Music background + sounds (not in this version).
