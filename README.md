# ***NOTE: this is NOT my final version of the project!

Although the application works fine, its NOT my final version of the Chess game. i mistakenly deleted the last updated version of the game, when i was deleting old code files and directories :(
This version was made couple of days before the last one. it lacks some features like sounds,additional graphics,code,optimization... but still got the main important functions and features.

Features:
  1. Play vs AI or against human on the same computer or via LAN.
  2. AI based on Minimax Search with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
  3. Undo moves – option to reverse the game at any time 1 move back, by pressing ‘p’.
  4. Restart game by pressing 'r'.
  5. Timer (not in this version).
  6. Choose color board.
  7. Music background (not in this version).
